motiondetection
===============

Here is my approach to motion detection using OpenCV and Python. Even this does not introduce a new algorithm, it serves as a simple guide for image processing.


Requirements
============

opencv: instead of downloading opencv entirely, you can just download a precompiled opencv binary for python from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/. I used opencv-python-2.4.9.win32-py2.7.exe

python and numpy: to simplify things, I used pythonxy python distribution. It can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/


how to run
==========

> python motiondetection.py

and that's it.
